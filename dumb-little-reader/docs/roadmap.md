# Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the dumb-little-reader, a simple RSS feed reader.

## Milestones

1. **Setup and Configuration**
    - Create a virtual environment and install required packages from `requirements.txt`.
    - Set up the FastAPI application in `main.py`.
    - Configure the application to use the FastAPI template and static file handling.

2. **RSS Feed Fetching**
    - Implement the `rss_fetcher.py` module to fetch and parse RSS feeds using the feedparser library.
    - Define the data models for Feed, Item, and Reaction in `models.py`.

3. **Web Endpoints**
    - Implement the web endpoints in `endpoints.py` for subscribing to feeds, fetching items, marking items as read, and reacting to items.
    - Integrate the endpoints with the FastAPI application in `main.py`.

4. **User Interface**
    - Design the user interface using HTML and CSS in `templates/index.html` and `static/css/styles.css`.
    - Implement the JavaScript functionality for user interactions in `static/js/scripts.js`.

5. **Error Handling and Testing**
    - Implement error handling for potential issues in `error_handling.py`.
    - Write tests for the RSS fetcher, endpoints, and error handling in `tests/test_rss_fetcher.py`, `tests/test_endpoints.py`, and `tests/test_error_handling.py`.

6. **Deployment**
    - Set up a Modal account and configure the `modal.toml` file.
    - Deploy the application to Modal.

7. **Documentation**
    - Write the AI developer documentation in `docs/ai_developer_documentation.md`.
    - Update the README.md file with instructions on how to set up, test, and deploy the application.
