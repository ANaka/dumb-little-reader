# AI Developer Documentation

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the FastAPI application locally:

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

3. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

4. Run tests using pytest:

```
pytest app/tests
```

## Deployment

1. Create a Modal account and install the `modal-client` package.

2. Set up a token for your Modal account.

3. Deploy the Python code to Modal by running the following command:

```
modal deploy
```

## Application Structure

- `app/main.py`: The main FastAPI application file.
- `app/rss_fetcher.py`: Contains the RSS fetcher class for fetching and parsing RSS feeds.
- `app/models.py`: Contains the data models for the application.
- `app/endpoints.py`: Defines the web endpoints for the application.
- `app/error_handling.py`: Implements error handling for the application.
- `app/tests/test_rss_fetcher.py`: Contains tests for the RSS fetcher.
- `app/tests/test_endpoints.py`: Contains tests for the web endpoints.
- `app/tests/test_error_handling.py`: Contains tests for error handling.

## Questions and Areas for Further Development

1. How should we handle pagination for loading more items when the user scrolls down?
2. What is the preferred method for storing user reactions (liked, loved, disliked) to feed items?
3. Are there any additional features or improvements that should be considered for the user interface?
4. How can we optimize the performance of fetching and displaying RSS feed items?
5. Are there any security concerns that should be addressed in the application?
